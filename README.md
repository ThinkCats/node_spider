In order to download some pictures from some websites,I write this nodejs tool(In fact,this is my proctise work).

Eh... I called it a spider though it is not a really perfect program code. Anyway,it works well,lol....

Ok,let's begin.

You should install cheerio,async before run the img_spider, the command isï¼š
npm install cheerio,
npm install async

I write this code on Linux,so, I can use "curl" to get remote resources.You can use 'http' and 'get' if you run it on Windows.

This'all.
